This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

== curl
include::{snippets}/home/curl-request.adoc[]

== request
include::{snippets}/home/http-request.adoc[]

== request parameters
include::{snippets}/home/request-parameters.adoc[]

== response
include::{snippets}/home/http-response.adoc[]

== response body
include::{snippets}/home/response-body.adoc[]

== response fields
include::{snippets}/home/response-fields.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
